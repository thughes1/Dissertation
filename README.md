# Transfer Learning and Moonboard Climbing

# Abstract

     Within recent years, the sport of rock climbing has surged in popularity, with many climbers seeking tools to increase their strength and technique. One such tool is the 
Moonboard, a standardised climbing wall with a global app, allowing climbers to set and attempt problems, established by other users. However, these grades often lack accuracy, hindering training and leaving climbers questioning their own performance. 

Previous research has attempted to address the arbitrariness within grading on the Moonboard by applying various supervised learning techniques, however, they often faced issues surrounding overfitting and bias. Despite this, improvements have been made through increased optimisation of features. 

One significant limitation in current research is its lack of foresight. The models produced are restricted to the specific Moonboard set on which they were trained, rendering them quickly outdated as new Moonboard sets are continually introduced

This project aims to explore the application of transfer learning across multiple Moonboard sets by developing a predictive model capable of accurately grading climbing problems. This endeavour not only enhances the climber's experience but also lays the groundwork for future research, mitigating issues related to redundancy.
